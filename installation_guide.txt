- Add C:\Python27 and C:\Python27\Scripts to the system environment path (if you're using linux env, add python and python\script to the system environment path if you already have another version of python in your system. DO NOT use the default python on MAC!)

- to verify the installation step, open terminal (or cmd) and type in: 
$ python
If no errors occurs, Python is successfully installed to your system.
